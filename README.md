## Hi, I'm Allyson ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate web developer and current student at LearningFuze, where I am expanding my skills in TypeScript, HTML5, CSS, and React. With one year of experience, I specialize in creating dynamic, user-friendly applications that deliver seamless experiences.

My career began in the fashion industry in San Diego, California, where I interned for the renowned designer Zandra Rhodes at 16. While studying at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, I transitioned into the Entertainment Industry as a costumer, a role in which I excelled in for over ten years. I'm now pursuing my passion for technology and working towards my goals in development.

âœ¨ I'm currently on my "senior-side" of my coding boot-camp and about to start my senior full-stack project! <br>
